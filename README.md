This is the code developed for the Junior Backend developer vacancy test.

The project is dockerized and made with the Spring Boot framework.

In order to run it, it is recommended to first do a "docker-compose up" 
on the console and then if you run the command "mvnw spring-boot: run" on another console. End points can be viewed with the postman program.
